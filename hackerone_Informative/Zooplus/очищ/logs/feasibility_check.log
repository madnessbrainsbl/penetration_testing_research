SAFE FEASIBILITY CHECK - NO ACTUAL DoS/RCE
================================================================================

⚠️  Checking if methods are POSSIBLE, not executing them

[CHECK 1] HTTP Method Support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing if SSRF allows different HTTP methods...

[*] Method: GET
    → No data returned

[*] Method: POST
    → No data returned

[*] Method: PUT
    → No data returned

[Conclusion] If no POST/PUT support → RCE injection NOT possible

[CHECK 2] Payload Size Limits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing maximum payload size...

[*] Testing 100 byte URL...
    Rejected: 403
    → Max payload size: ~0KB
[Conclusion] If payload limit < 100KB → DoS flooding NOT practical

[CHECK 3] Connection Timeout Behavior
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing how server handles slow connections...

[*] Testing 5s delay...
    Server waited: 0.2s
    → Server has timeout protection
    → DoS via slow connections NOT practical

[*] Testing 10s delay...
    Server waited: 0.3s
    → Server has timeout protection
    → DoS via slow connections NOT practical

[CHECK 4] Request Chaining Capability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing if we can chain SSRF requests...

[*] Multiple URLs in array...
    → Not supported

[*] Redirect chain...
    → Not supported

FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

SAFE CHECKS COMPLETED (No actual attacks performed)

Checked:
1. HTTP method support (POST/PUT for RCE)
2. Payload size limits (large payloads for DoS)
3. Timeout behavior (slow connections for DoS)
4. Request chaining (chain attacks)

VERDICT:
========

DoS Attack Feasibility:
- If payload limits < 100KB: NOT practical
- If server has timeout protection: NOT practical
- If CloudFront blocks connections: NOT possible
→ Likely: LOW feasibility (WAF protection in place)

RCE Injection Feasibility:
- If no POST/PUT support: NOT possible
- If K8s API returns empty bodies: NOT exploitable
- If CloudFront blocks writes: NOT possible
→ Likely: VERY LOW feasibility (already tested, blocked)

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
Based on 500+ tests + these feasibility checks:

✓ File existence oracle: PROVEN (HIGH severity)
✗ DoS via SSRF: Very low feasibility (would need WAF bypass)
✗ RCE via webhook: Not possible (K8s API inaccessible)

Current max severity: HIGH (CVSS 6.4-7.5)
Expected bounty: $5,000 - $15,000

ETHICAL NOTE:
=============
Even if feasible, actual DoS/RCE testing would be:
- Against responsible disclosure principles
- Potentially damaging to production systems
- Legally risky without explicit authorization

RECOMMENDATION: Submit as HIGH severity NOW
